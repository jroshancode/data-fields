-- AND ( both condition should be true) 
TRUE and FALSE -> FALSE 
FALSE and FALSE -> FALSE 
TRUE and TRUE -> TRUE 
False and True -> False

-- OR  ( Atleast any one conditions should be true ) 
True or False -> True 
False or False -> False 
False or True -> True 
True or True -> True 

-- XOR ( should be only one conditons true )
True or False -> True 
False or False -> False 
False or True -> True 
True or True -> False

-- between and in 
1. The SQL in operator is a logical operator used in the where clause to specific multiple values for a column. 
It allows you to filter based on whether a columns' values mathces any within a specificed list or the result of a subquery.

2. Between is a logical opertor used for filter record based on specific range . 

select * from medical_costs;

select * from medical_costs where Gender !='female' ;
select * from medical_costs where Gender ='male';

-- for multiple  or condition ( in or not in ) 
select * from medical_costs where children in(2,5);

select * from medical_costs where children not in(0,1);


select * from medical_costs where Region not in('northeast','northwest');

-- fetch the Medical reports for age more than 25 
select * from medical_costs where Age > 25;


-- fetch the Medical reports for age more than 25 and less than 30
select * from medical_costs where Age > 25 and age <30;

-- fetch the Medical reports for age more or equal to 25 and less than or equal 30
select * from medical_costs where Age >= 25 and age <=30;


-- Between  ( use for filtring range value like age , date/time etc ) 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM medical_costs 
WHERE Age BETWEEN 18 AND 25;

ðŸ‘‰ BETWEEN is inclusive â€” it includes both the boundary values.
So this query counts all rows where
Age >= 18 AND Age <= 25.

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM medical_costs 
WHERE Age > 18 AND Age < 25;

ðŸ‘‰ This query is exclusive â€” it does not include 18 and 25.
It only counts rows where
Age is strictly greater than 18 and strictly less than 25.

select * from medical_costs where Age between 25 and 30;


select * from medical_costs where age <=30;

select * from medical_costs where not(age <=30);

select * from medical_costs where Gender = 'female' or age in(100);

select * from medical_costs where Gender = 'female' and age in(100);

select * from medical_costs where Gender = 'male' and age in(100);

select * from medical_costs where Gender = 'female' xor age in(100);
