# Where ( fileter number of rows for specific column ) 
The WHERE clause in SQL is used to filter records that meet a specified condition or set of conditions. 
It is a fundamental part of SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements, allowing you to work with a subset of data rather than the entire table.

-- count total number of records for age 18 
select * from medical where age =18;

select count(*) from medical where age =18;

-- with order by 
select * from medical where age =18 order by `medical cost` desc;

-- for smoker is yes
select * from medical where smoker ='yes';
select count(*) from medical where smoker ='yes';
select * from medical where smoker ='yes' order by `medical cost` desc;


select * from my_db.train;
