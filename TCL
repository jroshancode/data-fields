-- The primary TCL commands used in MySQL are:
COMMIT: This command saves all changes made during the current transaction permanently to the database. Once committed, the changes cannot be undone using ROLLBACK.

-- 1️ COMMIT
-- Saves all changes permanently in the database.

UPDATE emp 
SET salary = salary + 200 
WHERE emp_id = 5;
-- UPDATE accounts 
-- SET balance = balance + 500 
-- WHERE account_id = 102;

COMMIT;

-- ROLLBACK: This command undoes all changes made during the current transaction since the last COMMIT or SAVEPOINT. 
It restores the database to its state before the transaction began or to a specific savepoint.

-- 2 ROLLBACK

-- Undo all changes since the last COMMIT.
UPDATE emp 
SET salary = salary + 200 
WHERE emp_id = 6;
-- DELETE FROM emp  WHERE id = 50;
ROLLBACK;


-- 3️ SAVEPOINT
-- Creates a checkpoint inside a transaction, so you can roll back partially.

-- SAVEPOINT: This command sets a named point within a transaction to which you can later roll back. This allows for partial rollbacks within a larger transaction.

BEGIN;

UPDATE emp SET salary = salary + 2000 WHERE emp_id = 1;
SAVEPOINT t1;

UPDATE emp SET salary = salary + 3000 WHERE emp_id = 2;
SAVEPOINT t2;

UPDATE emp SET salary = salary + 5000 WHERE emp_id = 5;

-- undo only last update
ROLLBACK TO t2;

COMMIT;

-- delete 
 -- for Delete , insert and Update 
begin; 
savepoint t1;
delete from emp where emp_id = 5;
savepoint t2;
UPDATE emp SET salary = salary + 5000 WHERE emp_id = 3; -- 82000

savepoint t3;
delete from emp where emp_id = 3;
