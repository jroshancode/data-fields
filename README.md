## What is SQL?
  SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful language used to communicate with and manage data stored in relational databases. 
  It enables users to create, modify, and manipulate data structures and records. SQL is commonly employed to query, insert, update, 
  and delete records, as well as to design and alter the database itself. With its versatility, SQL can handle complex queries and 
  process large volumes of data, making it the most widely used language for managing databases across various applications.

## Key Functions of SQL:
  Data Querying: Retrieve data from a database using the SELECT statement.
  Data Manipulation: Perform operations like inserting (INSERT), updating (UPDATE), and deleting (DELETE) data.
  Data Definition: Define the structure of a database using Data Definition Language (DDL) commands like CREATE, ALTER, and DROP.
  Data Control: Control access and permissions to data using Data Control Language (DCL) commands like GRANT and REVOKE.

## Importance of SQL
  Industry Standard: SQL is the most widely used database language across the globe. Almost every relational database uses SQL for database queries and management.
  Scalability: SQL databases can handle a huge volume of data, making it essential for data-driven businesses and organizations.
  Cross-Platform Compatibility: SQL can be used on various platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux) and supports different database systems.
  Declarative Nature: SQL is a declarative language, which means that users specify what they want to do with data rather than how to do it, simplifying database management.
  Data Integrity: SQL helps enforce data integrity and security with features like constraints (e.g., PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY) and permissions (DCL commands).

## Applications of SQL

  Data Storage: SQL is the standard language used to store and manipulate data in relational databases.
  Data Definition: SQL is used to create, alter, and manage the structure of database objects such as tables, indexes, and views.
  Data Retrieval: SQL allows users to query and filter data from one or more tables, returning specific information.
  Data Manipulation: SQL can be used to update, insert, and delete records within a database.
  Data Security: SQL manages access controls, granting and revoking user permissions to maintain data security.
  Data Analysis: SQL supports data analysis by performing calculations, generating reports, and creating visualizations based on queried data.

## Advantages of SQL
  Ease of Use: SQL is user-friendly, with clear syntax that makes it easy to learn and understand. Writing queries and reading results is straightforward for users of all levels.
  Standardization: SQL is a standardized language, making it compatible with numerous database management systems. This ensures seamless data transfer across different systems.
  Scalability: SQL can handle large datasets and scale with growing business needs.
  Flexibility: SQL is highly adaptable, capable of handling both simple queries and complex data analysis.
  Security: SQL includes built-in security features such as user authentication, encryption, and access control, protecting data from unauthorized access.
  Performance: SQL is optimized for performance, allowing for quick query execution and real-time data retrieval, making it a valuable tool for decision-making.

## Limitations of SQL
  Complexity: SQL can be difficult to learn, especially for beginners unfamiliar with database design and programming concepts.
  Limited Support for Non-Relational Data: SQL is specifically designed for relational databases, which may not be ideal for managing non-relational data formats like JSON or XML.
  Cost: Some SQL-based database management systems are expensive to license, particularly for large-scale enterprise applications.
  Scalability Challenges: Although SQL is scalable, managing very large datasets with a centralized architecture can pose challenges and lead to performance bottlenecks.
  Performance Issues with Large Datasets: SQL may experience performance degradation when handling exceptionally large datasets or highly complex queries, potentially impacting user experience.

## Relational vs. Non-Relational Databases

1. Relational Databases (SQL):

    Data is stored in structured tables with relationships between different tables.
    Provides ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring data reliability and integrity.
    Suitable for complex querying and data analysis.
    More rigid schema with predefined structure.

2. Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL):

  Data is stored in a flexible format (key-value pairs, documents, columns, etc.).
  Offers scalability and better performance for unstructured or semi-structured data.
  Provides BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency) for high availability and distributed systems.
  Used for high-throughput, large datasets with simple queries.

# SQL vs. NoSQL
  SQL (Relational Databases):
  Uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for database interaction.
  Suitable for applications where data relationships and integrity are crucial.
  Requires a fixed schema, making it less flexible in terms of data structure.
  NoSQL (Non-Relational Databases):
  No specific query language; interaction happens through APIs or other query models depending on the database (e.g., MongoDB uses MQL—Mongo Query Language).
  Offers flexibility in schema design, allowing the data model to evolve over time.
  Ideal for high-velocity, high-volume data with minimal structure, such as real-time data processing or big data applications.

# Popular Database Management Systems (DBMS)
  MySQL:
  Open-source relational database known for its speed and reliability. Widely used in web applications.
  PostgreSQL:
  An advanced, open-source relational database with support for more complex operations such as JSON data types and advanced indexing.
  Microsoft SQL Server:
  A commercial relational database developed by Microsoft, offering robust integration with Microsoft’s technology stack and enterprise-grade features.
  Oracle Database:
  A powerful relational database known for handling large-scale enterprise systems. It offers advanced security and performance features.
  MongoDB:
  A popular NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents. Used in applications requiring fast, flexible, and scalable data storage

What is DDL? List some common DDL commands.

    DDL stands for Data Definition Language, used to define, modify, and manage the structure of database objects. Common DDL commands are:
    CREATE: To create new tables, views, indexes, etc.
  
    ALTER: To modify existing database structures, such as adding columns to a table.
    DROP: To delete objects, like tables or indexes.
    TRUNCATE: To quickly remove all records from a table without logging each row deletion.
    RENAME: To rename a database object, such as a table or column.

2. Explain the purpose and usage of the CREATE TABLE statement.
    The CREATE TABLE statement is used to define a new table in a database.
    It specifies the table name, column names, data types, and constraints (e.g., primary key, foreign key, not null).
    Example: -
    CREATE TABLE employees (
      id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(50), 
      salary DECIMAL(10,2)
    );

    CREATE TABLE Employees (
        EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
        FirstName VARCHAR(50),
        LastName VARCHAR(50),
        BirthDate DATE
    );

3. What are constraints? Name a few and explain their usage.
    Constraints enforce rules on data in a table. Some common constraints are:
    PRIMARY KEY: Uniquely identifies each record.
    FOREIGN KEY: Enforces a relationship between two tables.
    UNIQUE: Ensures all values in a column are unique.
    CHECK: Restricts values based on a condition.
    NOT NULL: Ensures that a column cannot have NULL values.

4. What is the difference between ALTER TABLE and DROP TABLE statements?
    ALTER TABLE is used to modify the structure of an existing table, such as adding/removing columns, modifying data types, or adding/removing constraints.
    DROP TABLE is used to completely remove a table and its data from the database.
    Example ALTER TABLE: ALTER TABLE employees ADD email VARCHAR(50);
    Example DROP TABLE: DROP TABLE employees;

5. Explain the purpose and usage of the TRUNCATE TABLE statement.
    TRUNCATE TABLE is used to quickly remove all rows from a table, while preserving the table structure.
    It is faster than using a DELETE statement without a WHERE clause, as TRUNCATE does not generate transaction logs.
    Example: TRUNCATE TABLE orders;

6. What is the difference between DROP TABLE and TRUNCATE TABLE?
    DROP TABLE removes the table definition and all its data from the database.
    TRUNCATE TABLE removes all the data from the table, but the table structure (columns, constraints, etc.) remains.
    DROP TABLE is a DDL operation, while TRUNCATE TABLE is a DML (Data Manipulation Language) operation.
    DROP TABLE is irreversible, while TRUNCATE TABLE can be rolled back within a transaction.

7. What is the difference between DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP?
    DELETE: Deletes specific rows from a table. It can be rolled back and generates a log.
    TRUNCATE: Removes all rows from a table without logging each row, so it’s faster but cannot be rolled back.
    DROP: Deletes an entire database object (like a table), along with its structure. It is also non-reversible.

CHAR stores fixed-length strings, padding shorter values with spaces to reach the specified length, which can be faster for consistent-length data but wastes space. VARCHAR stores variable-length strings, only using the space for the actual characters plus some overhead for length information. Use CHAR for consistent data like state abbreviations and VARCHAR for variable data like names or addresses
