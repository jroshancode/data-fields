-- Operators 

SQL operators are reserved words or characters used in SQL statements to perform operations like comparisons, calculations, and logical evaluations on data. 
They are crucial for filtering, manipulating, and retrieving specific data sets from a database.
# Operator:- 
1. Arithmetical Operator ( + , - , * , / , % ) 
2. Assignment Operator ( =, +=, -= , *= , /=, %=) 
3. Comparision Operator ( < , > , != , <> , <= , >= ) 
4. Logical Operator ( OR, AND , XOR , NOT ) 


-- Arithmetical Operator ( + , - , * , / , % )
